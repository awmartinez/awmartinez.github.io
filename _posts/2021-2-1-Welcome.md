The Martinez Research Group (AKA Team AWesoMe) is an interdisciplinary and collaborative research group working at the interface of chemistry, biology, physics, medicine and engineering. Our home is located in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Cal Poly. We are generally interested in research projects that have real-world applications, and that involve clever and simple solutions to complex problems. Currently, our primary research focus is on the development of paper-based fluidic devices, also known as microPADs, for use as point-of-care diagnostics and as tools for basic research and teaching. Our group members are friendly, creative, curious and interested in contributing positively to society.

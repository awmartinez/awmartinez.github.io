The Martinez Research Group (AKA Team AWesoMe) is an interdisciplinary, collaborative research group working at the interface of chemistry, biology, physics, medicine and engineering. While we are not trained formally in all of these fields, we borrow tools, techniques and theory from every useful source. Our home is located in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Cal Poly. We are generally interested in research projects that have real-world applications, that involve clever and simple solutions to complex problems, and that can be performed on a low budget. Currently, our primary research focus is on the development of paper-based fluidic devices, also known as microPADs, for use as point-of-care diagnostics and as tools for basic research and teaching. Our group members are friendly, creative, curious and interested in contributing positively to society. Please do not hesitate to reach out you have any questions.
